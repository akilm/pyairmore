# Introduction

This section is primarily intended for anyone who wants to contribute to
`pyairmore` or anyone who is interested in learning how `pyairmore` works.

`pyairmore` extends some classes of `requests` library in order to provide
easier access to Airmore server, those of which are:

 - `AirmoreRequest` which extends `PreparedRequest` from `requests`
 - `AirmoreSession` which extends `Session` from `requests`
